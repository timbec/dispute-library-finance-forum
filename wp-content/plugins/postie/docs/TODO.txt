AddOn Ideas
Header/footer stripper - user provides "selector" (xpath) to identify header/footer and element is removed safely for html
    selector = "div.footer" (div with the class "footer")
    May need to remove parent (or granparent of element)
    How to help non-techies build the selector?
Email notifications - use postie_email_* filters and some new settings panels along with some templating. User can select which post status fire the email.
Configurable message for "post confirmation" - variable substitution, by post status

Bugs

=========
Revised parsing logic

convert all logic to filters
before session filter
before mail filter
email/account filter
attachment filter
iterate through each html element (p, div, etc) and apply all filters and buffer output
after mail filter
after session filter

convert plain text to html using same logic as wp - i.e. all text is html
Original text is never modified
There are filters that modify
  meta data (tags, categories, date)
  content (start, end, newlines, linkifying)
